# Factor variables

## Factors


- A special type of variable to indicate categories
- both *labels* and their *order* (i.e. numbers) 
- By default text variables are stored in factors during input
- numeric categorical variables have to be converted to factors manually
- `factor` creates a new factor with specified labels

- <span style="color:white">Inspect the `fbi` object. How many variables are there? Which type does each of the variables have?</span>
- <span style="color:white">Make a summary of year</span>
- <span style="color:white">Make year  a factor variable: `fbi$year <- factor(fbi$year)`</span>
- <span style="color:white">Compare summary of year to the previous result</span>
- <span style="color:white">Are there other variables that should be factors (or vice versa)? </span>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(classdata)

dim(fbi)

summary(fbi$year)

fbi$year.factor = factor(fbi$year)

summary(fbi$year.factor)

```

## Note: factors in boxplots

boxplots in ggplot2 only work properly if the x variable is a character variable or a factor:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(classdata)
```

```{r}
twoyear <- dplyr::filter(fbi, year %in% c(1981, 2020))
```

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, aes(x = year, y = count)) + geom_boxplot()
```
</p>
<p class="double-flow">
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, aes(x = factor(year), y = count)) + geom_boxplot()
```
</p>

</div>

## Data types: checking and casting

Checking for, and casting between types: 

- `str`, `mode` provide info on type
- `is.XXX` (with XXX either `factor, int, numeric, logical, character, ...` ) checks for specific type
- `as.XXX` casts to specific type


## Casting between types

![](images/casting.png)
**Note:** `as.numeric` applied to a factor retrieves *order* of labels, not labels, even if those could be interpreted as numbers.

To get the labels of a factor as numbers, first cast to character and then to a number.

## Levels of factor variables

- `levels(x)` shows us the levels of factor variable `x` in their current order
- factor variables often have to be re-ordered for ease of comparisons
- We can specify the order of the levels by explicitly listing them, see `help(factor)`
- We can make the order of the levels in one variable dependent on the summary statistic of another variable


## Reordering factor levels - manual

```{r}
levels(fbi$type)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
fbi$type = factor(fbi$type)
levels(fbi$type)
```

manually (extremely sensitive to typos):

```{r}
levels(factor(fbi$type, 
              levels=c("larceny", "burglary", 
                     "motor_vehicle_theft", "aggravated_assault", 
                     "robbery", "arson", "rape_legacy", "rape_revised", "homicide")
              )
       )
```

## What will happen if there are typos?

```{r}
temp = factor(fbi$type, levels=c("Larceny", "burglary", 
                     "motor_vehicle_theft", "aggravated_assault", 
                     "robbery", "arson", "rape_legacy", "rape_revised", "homicide"))
levels(temp)
unique(temp)
```

## Reordering factor levels - using another variable

`reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

reorder levels in factor by values in `numbers`. Use `function` to summarise (average is used by default). 

```{r}
levels(reorder(fbi$type, fbi$count, na.rm=TRUE))
```

missing values in `numbers`? make sure to use parameter `na.rm=TRUE`!

## Your turn {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

<span style="color:white">For this your turn use the `fbi` object from the `classdata` package. </span>

- <span style="color:white">Introduce a rate of the number of reported offenses by population into the `fbi` data. You could use the *Ames standard* to make values comparable to a city of the size of Ames (population ~70,000).</span>
- <span style="color:white">
Plot boxplots of crime rates by different types of crime. How can you make axis text legible? </span>
- <span style="color:white">
Reorder the boxplots of crime rates, such that the boxplots are ordered by their medians. </span>
- <span style="color:white">
For one type of crime (`subset` or `filter`) plot boxplots of rates by state, reorder boxplots by median crime rates</span>


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
fbi$crime.rate = fbi$count / fbi$population * 70000
ggplot(data = fbi, aes(x = type, y = crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

fbi1 = fbi
fbi1$type = factor(fbi1$type)
levels(fbi1$type)
levels(fbi1$type)[c(1, 6)] = c("assault", "MV.theft")
ggplot(data = fbi1, aes(x = type, y = crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

fbi2 = fbi1
fbi2$type = factor(fbi2$type, levels = levels(reorder(fbi1$type, fbi1$crime.rate, median, na.rm=TRUE)))
ggplot(data = fbi2, aes(x = type, y = crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

fbi3 = dplyr::filter(fbi, type == "burglary")
mode(fbi3$state)
fbi3$state = factor(fbi3$state)
fbi3$state = factor(fbi3$state, levels = levels(reorder(fbi3$state, fbi3$crime.rate, median, na.rm=TRUE)))
ggplot(data = fbi3, aes(x = state, y = crime.rate)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```

## Changing Levels' names

```{r}
fbi$type = factor(fbi$type)
levels(fbi$type)
```

```{r}
levels(fbi$type)[4] = "murder"

levels(fbi$type)
```
